Content was recovered between http://archive.is, the Google Feeds API,
and a checkout I found on my disk. We've generated a build environment,
integrated missing logs into the source tree, and made the output
available as a Tor hidden service: http://muflax65ngodyewp.onion.

If you'd like to access the rendered content, but don't have an onion
router available to you, access is available via Virgil's [patched
Tor2Web instance][onioncity].
