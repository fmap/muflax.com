Let’s see…

I did a bunch of stuff I don’t properly understand enough yet to talk
about without making an ass of myself, and even though that hasn’t ever
stopped me before, I don’t wanna contribute too much to People Being
Wrong On The Internet if I can help it…

And all other projects won’t have anything meaningful to show off or
talk about for some time to come, and “I read these books; they don’t
suck” posts aren’t very interesting (unless I can at least say something
about them)…

And this situation isn’t gonna change anytime soon, and this is still
primarily a practice log (maybe we should call an ironic purpose a
“telol”?), so even though I have a bunch of drafts, I don’t wanna just
dump my `crazy.txt`[^crazy] here without at least occasionally
balancing it with `not_actually_crazy.txt`.

So, uh, what am I gonna talk about the next few months? Guess I’ll have
to become ultra-productive and cram in some more minor projects.

しい〜〜〜ん

Yeah ok, volume will probably just go down and I’ll try to mention [cool
shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_trSIBCgF0) and minor projects
until stuff gets interesting again. (Lowered the road dial again for a
while.)

Hint: someone scanned Westergaard’s Introduction to Tonal Theory and I
hear it will also appear on the usual sites in a few days. Just fyi.

On a totally unrelated note, I’ve started reading Westergaard’s book and
I’m genuinely impressed. It looks like a proper textbook about a sane
theory with lots of examples and a clear, logical structure throughout.
Haven’t had much time to work on it yet, but it looks very promising.

Some drug updates.

-   Modafinil: useless as a normal upper, mediocre as a sleep
    substitute, great for “fuck deadline can’t afford to sleep fuck
    fuck”. The effect during waking hours is not noticeably better than
    caffeine for me. If it weren’t so expensive, I’d run a double-blind
    test to compare side-effects and get a more precise idea, but so
    it’s just not worth it. Will likely keep a small emergency supply on
    hand, but otherwise I’ll stick to nicotine and caffeine.

-   Nicotine: started to smoke cigarettes again. Not a lot (i.e.
    \<40/month), and it’s not really about the nicotine either, which is
    almost anti-addictive for me. Despite clear benefits and wanting to
    use it regularly, I keep forgetting I have large supplies of
    lozenges and go days (and sometimes weeks) without any for no good
    reason, and even when I use them, it’s never more than
    4mg/day.[^nicotine]

    So why smoke? Because I want something destructive - a tiny,
    controlled source of it, yes, but to deliberately do something of no
    use - no, not enough! - to take an action fully aware that it brings
    nothing but harm to myself, is to say, no, I cannot be satisfied; to
    say to optimization itself, nothing you can do will ever make me
    happy; this is my vote of discord, my dissatisfaction with order -
    this one is for decay.

I made a [Twitter account for drunken
confessions](https://twitter.com/#!/drunkflax). If I can’t say them to
the person I mean them for, I can at least say them in general just to
have them said, to lower the barrier - a practice round instead of just
sadness. Maybe it’s gone tomorrow, maybe not. Don’t read them. ~~I made
it for you.~~ Take with a grain of salt, placed on the back of your hand
and a slice of lemon; count your shots.

I feel like many arguments could be more easily resolved if people more
routinely asked themselves the First Rule of Debugging, i.e. “What are
you trying to do with that?”.

I’ve failed to state that enough in the past (and I’ve added “state what
this is trying to accomplish” to my list of rules to observe in future
writing), so here’s an example for practice.

In Scott’s [wrestling with virtue
ethics](http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/10/book-review-after-virtue-or-somebody-here-is-really-confused-and-i-just-hope-its-not-me/)
[^pad], I was reminded how I had always assumed (if not
explicitly, then implicitly in how I write) that my specific problems
with ethics generalize and then how I was somewhat upset how someone
could have the nerve to develop ideas that might work for their
problems, maybe, but not mine!, what sacrilege.

In particular, I have no clue what I want (I feel like I may have some
preferences in forced decisions (i.e. almost all of them), but that’s
far from wanting things for their own sake), so theories about “getting
what I want” are of no use to me (regardless of their validity), but I
know “the kind of person” I don’t want to be
(“[apophatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophatic_theology) virtue
ethics”, you say?), but at the same time (and for good reasons I won’t
elaborate on), I don’t trust my own ideas of what “good” is and that
many common heuristics - trust your instincts, use empathy, follow your
heart - are *horrible* advice for me because I’m at least potentially a
Bad Person(tm) and *I will fuck people over* if you’re so stupid to make
me run on instinct, so I don’t just need (meta-)ethics to resolve
conflicts for me, but to even provide (some of?) my values in the first
place.

So any theory that requires me to load it with my values first is
utterly useless to me because [it doesn’t solve any of my actual
problems](http://www.viruscomix.com/page535.html). For example, my
motivation for making locality a requirement for any meta-ethical theory
is that I don’t want to be held responsible - including by abstract
principles - for things I have no possible way of doing right. Or as
Kant is commonly (and uncharacteristically) summarized, “ought implies
can”. I don’t know what “the Good” is, in terms of a specific outcome or
kind of world. There are narratives that shape what I think of as a
“good world”, but these are clearly contingent and very non-mainstream
(currently, anyway[^pol]). A defining feature of any concept is
that there are some things it *isn’t*, some negative examples. But if
“the Good” is just whatever these narratives have led me to think of as
“Good”, then there is no way for me to be *wrong* about
it.[^wrong] The label “Good” is then just an arbitrary
placeholder. I don’t know if “Good” outside this usage has any meaning
either, but *if* so, I want to at least cover my ass. Thus, Moral
Realism That Doesn’t Do Anything.

Interestingly, I *don’t* seem to apply this same thinking to the past.
Even though Bad Shit happened[^close], I’m completely unwilling
to let it go and still consider Things I Literally Have No Longer Any
Causal Control Over[^mol] just as relevant and so a single
negative example can devastate me and *keep on* devastating
me.[^baum] I wonder if I should stop doing that…

[^crazy]:
    Actual content of `~/drafts`, my `crazy.txt`:

    -   start of a manifesto “Against Compassion”
    -   “I didn’t choose to be a wolf”, a meditation on fursonae
    -   sketches about “could zombies have saved the Nazi war effort?”
        until I got bored doing calculations (includes mostly worked-out
        Nazi Zombie campaign setting, incl. sketch of a metaphysics to
        make it reasonably coherent)
    -   a love poem to cheesecake
    -   “why everything sucks and will never ever get better”, a reading
        of some of Luther’s more obscure writing (on hold until I figure
        out if everything sucks and will never ever get better or not)
    -   an incomplete sketch of “Against Imagination”, which keeps on
        metastasizing as I add more and more anger to it, but it never
        really goes anywhere constructive and I wonder if I’m not just
        rewriting the Futurist Manifesto anyway
    -   “I’m the worst person to talk about politics, but I’m drunk and
        I have a pile of manifestos, try stoppin’ me”, an
        interdisciplinary attempt of political exploration
    -   several sketches and attempts of a new critical method I call
        Passive-Aggressive Deconstruction

    I think it’s obvious why those drafts never go anywhere.

[^nicotine]:
    I’m deliberately ignoring e-cigarettes even though they’re cheaper
    because I don’t want to accidentally establish a “suck on
    cigarettes” habit that might transfer to real cigarettes so I can
    always maintain a behavioral separation between “nicotine so my
    brain works” and “smoking for emotional reasons”, despite them
    sharing some drug effects. The nicotine in cigarettes is still
    welcome and I substitute accordingly, but it’s a bit of a pity I
    have to smoke strong brands just to remind me of her smell.

    In particular [this

    how virtue ethics is not useful in practice, and this (highly
    excerpted) exchange with Vladimir:

    was the thing that made me throw up my hands and say in a moment of
    amused desperation, *surely* you can’t be asserting this! I don’t
    have an issue with saying that virtue ethics isn’t really a *theory*
    of anything but more a label of a kind of discourse, a way of
    *doing* morality instead of thinking *about* morality, and that it
    is, to use Skinner’s terminology, still mostly prescientific. Fair
    enough.

    But to say that utilitarianism (or even better, deontology! The
    *simplest*, most straightforward example of deontological reasoning
    - don’t deceive - is highly controversial and virtually *nobody*
    agrees with it!) works most of the time is.. well, Scott is, to use
    Moldbug’s amusing phrase, “[not a blithering
    idiot](http://unqualified-reservations.blogspot.com/2013/03/sam-altman-is-not-blithering-idiot.html)”,
    so I can’t just say, “clearly he just doesn’t know what he’s talking
    about”. There must a disagreement not about results (because Scott
    is neither ignorant nor in denial), but about *the problem*. With a
    disparity this huge, we can’t be looking [at the same
    thing](http://blog.regehr.org/archives/861).

    One might be tempted to say, “this just proves that some people
    think inherently like virtue ethicists and some like utilitarians”,
    but that’s just throwing away all possibility of rational discourse
    forever, and most importantly, *this isn’t even the case*. (Even if
    this were the case, “get out of your weird bubble” would likely be a
    more appropriate response, but I’m not convinced this even applies
    to Scott, unlike say Kant.)

    If I were more the person I want to be, I would now be able to write
    an eloquent reply, but alas, the only answer I *am* capable of is a
    stare of incredulity (which I hate) or an incoherent angry rant
    (which I love). Wanting not to be abusive, I thus experimented with
    alternatives and came up with Passive-Aggressive Deconstruction,
    which is probably still trollish, but maybe not hostile. (Or at
    least amusingly so.)

    Essentially, and this is why I haven’t written more than sketches
    yet because this is still a lot of work, I just wanted to highlight
    by mere quotation how *Scott himself* uses virtue-ethical reasoning
    frequently *on his own blog*, and how then, tumblr-style, I could
    just add his comment pasted on a fitting `useless_utilitarian.jpg`
    after each quote and ask, “Why don’t I see a calculation here?” or
    “Why do you think this is a valid form of argument?”, so that after
    a sufficiently large number of instances of this, it would at least
    be more than an *assertion* of “I can’t believe you’re saying what I
    think you’re saying, but I don’t see what else you possible could
    mean to say”.

    But eh, now that I’ve outlined the general approach, I can’t be
    bothered to do it concretely. (\<3)

[^pol]:
    I don’t know of any way to discuss these things without either
    moving to a very different audience (which I have no interest in) or
    attempting an act of bridging a moral divide that is akin to making
    a lion speak. Regardless - and I don’t know if that is intentional
    or not - I might eventually have to get there if I ever want to go
    meta and discuss important figures in [Higher
    Criticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_criticism)
    directly and not just their ideas how to read the NT. But I’ve
    failed to tell Lutherans that they don’t understand Luther, so I’m
    not optimistic about that ever succeeding.

[^wrong]:
    To be a bit more accurate, the problem is how the concept is learned
    and it basically separates moral subjectivists from moral
    relativists. In the subjectivist view, “Good” is the extension of
    whatever collection of preferences I happen to hold, while moral
    relativists conceive of some distributed concept shared by a
    community, like a language.

    So for example and by analogy, there is a wrong way to speak French
    (even though there is no Standard Written Into The World Itself that
    tells us a priori what French “is” and even though boundaries might
    be fuzzy) and so it makes sense to say someone can learn French
    (because we can provide positive and negative examples). But under
    the subjectivist view, that is not the case because only *I* - or
    rather, the preferences in my skull - define the concept. As such, I
    can *teach* what “Good” means (i.e. *others* can be wrong about it),
    but I can’t *learn* it because I already, by construction, embody
    it. (This ethical egoism may, as a matter of fact, include the value
    of “altruism”, of course - values aren’t justifications.)

[^close]:
    Look, Internet, I’m sorry but we aren’t *that* close.

[^mol]:
    Well yes, Molinists can change the past, but then they have to
    negotiate with God and that doesn’t sound any easier, if you ask me…

[^baum]:
    As Baumeister famously argues, “[bad is stronger than
    good](http://www.csom.umn.edu/Assets/71516.pdf)”.
