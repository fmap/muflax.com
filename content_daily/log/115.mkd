As a simple safety precaution, and even though I don’t have a history of
escalating addictions[^addict], I’m set up a [Beeminder
goal](https://www.beeminder.com/muflax/goals/smoking) to limit my
cigarette use. I mean, the financial budget already keeps it at a
manageable level, but that’s what they all say, isn’t it?

Nonetheless, I did a simple cost comparisons[^patch] for a
certain (fairly representative) Rich European Nation with its
enlightened “heavily tax those who cost you less and who need the stuff
to self-regulate” drug policy:

-   decent cigarettes: \~0.25 Euro / 1mg nicotine
-   roll your own cigarettes: \~0.10 Euro / 1mg nicotine (all other
    tobacco products are somewhere between those two)
-   lozenges: \~0.06 Euro / 1mg nicotine (that’s for 4mg lozenges, which
    are easy to split in half, but if you want to actually dose 1mg,
    you’ll probably have to pay double)
-   e-cigarette: well… ok, I’m confused by how much usable nicotine they
    really contain, and what realistic costs are (including hardware),
    but my best estimate is something like \~0.10 Euro /
    1mg[^source] (especially as prices are expected to go up
    thanks to upcoming regulations), which surprises me as I thought
    they were a lot cheaper. Am I missing something?

I currently don’t have any reasonable way to circumvent those taxes
(Eastern European border, I miss ya), so it seems like I’m not actually
spending a whole lot of premium on cigarettes. Assuming a 4mg/day
maximum (which is a pretty hig upper bound of my current use), I’d have
to pay up to \~7 Eurons/month for the cognitive benefits through
lozenges (which also ignores that I skip days irregularly because I
forget about the stuff, which at least helps keep tolerance down).

If I add, say, 10 cigarettes/week (which is a similarly high long-term
estimate of my current use) and use lozenges otherwise for the same
4mg/day, I’d pay \~9 Eurons/months, not a lot more. (And I love tobacco
smoke and discolorations anyway, so this is a reasonable cost just for
the pleasant experience, but I’m weird that way. Always loved having
smoker friends for their smell, even though I only got interested in the
stuff itself a few years ago.) So once my current supplies run out,
that’s exactly what I intend to switch to.

But why stick with 4mg? Maybe that’s too much, maybe not enough? I need
a better way to quantify what benefits I get from nicotine (in terms of
cognitive enhancement, reduction of *ugh*, regulation of schizotypal
symptoms). So I thought about existing options to get data from:

-   I can’t use sleep data because my sleep patterns are very irregular
    and my Zeo data is basically worthless. Back when I tracked it
    regularly for a few months, I virtually *never* dropped below a ZQ
    of 90 and saw many anomalies (catastrophic night with a ZQ \> 120
    etc.), and now Zeo’s dead anyway (pbut).

-   Comparing “time spent on useful projects” is tricky because there’s
    a lot of noise, but it might be workable if I do it for a
    sufficiently long period of time and I’m tracking this anyway.

-   Anki seems too noisy to evaluate. What would I even measure? Answer
    time? Correctness percentage is (on average) held constant by the
    scheduling algorithm and it’s tricky to control for difficulty.

None of those sound too promising, so I’ve looked into useful short
tests I can run once every day. I want the total test suite to be short
(\<10min) so I don’t get bored, so I’ll stick with these 3 tests for 2
minutes each:

1.  [n-back](http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20FAQ) accuracy score

    I remember vaguely from gwern-sensei’s FAQ that it’s currently
    unknown if there’s a significant difference between single and dual
    n-back, and because I’m lazy I’ll start with single n-back. I’ll add
    sound when I get a [round tuit](http://blog.beeminder.com/tuit/).

2.  Answer time on simple arithmetic problems (“3+2=?”)

    This is [Seth Roberts](http://blog.sethroberts.net/)’ favorite. Many
    data points per day, plausible mechanism, useful skill. What’s not
    to like?

3.  [Stroop task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect) answer
    time

    There have been several studies that have shown that schizophrenics
    have significantly increased Stroop latencies, so it seems like a
    useful proxy test for schizotypy. The traditional positive/negative
    symptom tests (besides applying to most people in a philosophy
    department) are way too imprecise, so this will have to do.

I’ve [hacked together a quick
script](https://github.com/muflax/cogatrice) that takes care of the
assignments and tests, added a [simple Beeminder
goal](https://www.beeminder.com/muflax/goals/cogtest) to ensure daily
measurements and I’ll figure out how to analyze the data once I have
some. (It’ll take a bit for them to plateau anyway, so I can still work
out problems in the protocol as they come up.)

There’s of course still the issue of randomization and blinding.
E-cigarettes are relatively easy to blind, but everything else seems
hard (use herbal / low-nicotine tobacco that tastes similar?) to
impossible (find similar mint lozenges?). So I can’t properly control
for placebo, but I can still learn some information about dosage. Next
time I buy new lozenges, I’ll also buy weaker ones because they all look
and taste the same and so I can blind *strength*. Until then and in
addition, I can randomize *scheduling* - I simply randomly do the tests
first and then take the nicotine or the other way around. That still
provides a baseline to compare the intervention with. Lastly, I’ve also
re-instituted my detailed drug log (which I only needed to avoid some
nasty interactions, mostly with MAOIs, which I haven’t taken in some
time) so I can spot potential patterns.

Empiricism!

So it seems I’m getting back into statistics and how to read scientific
papers, and hey, I have some old notes but how much can I’ve really
forgotten? Let’s review some simple stuff. What was a p-value again,
Wiki-sama?

Oh for fuck’s sake.

[^addict]:
    I mean, look at that graph. If being very inconsistent in everything
    I do is a superpower, drug use is probably the only area where it
    pays off.

[^patch]:
    Ignoring patches, which I found really hard to dose, and gum, which
    everyone I know who tried to use it had issues with. I also find it
    difficult to take absorption rates into account, but the “1mg”
    number is my best guess of effective nicotine, taking the numbers on
    cigarette boxes at face-value.

    It’s also funny how the nicotine content for each product does *not*
    generally affect it’s price much (if at all).

[^source]:
    Raw nicotine content in the liquid isn’t informative as such because
    it ignores the absorption rate (for which I couldn’t find a good
    source), other components besides nicotine, and so on. I ultimately
    went with the quantity of liquid former smokers typically end up
    using, which seems like a more useful proxy. However, even there
    good correlations are rarely present and estimates vary a lot. My
    (not particularly informed) best guess, based on that one study with
    self-medicating schizophrenics and various forums with smokers, is
    that one medium-to-high-strength cartridge equals \~6-10 cigarettes.

    I did find decent estimates for lozenges (and they fit my personal
    experience), so those costs are more reliable.
