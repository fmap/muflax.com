Mostly just practice, which I report for beeminding purposes. Yay?

---

I’ve extended the cognitive tests with a simple questionnaire for some
daily variables and now also track daily mood split into four variables
(energy level, comfortableness, “everything makes sense”-ness, [body
load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_load)) on a scale of
1-5[^scale]. I don’t expect that to yield useful correlations
(with better than retrodictive powers), but it’s trivial to do, so
whatever.

Also, first result: apparently, the more tired I am, the *better* I get
at the Stroop test. Can’t rule out practice effects yet, of course, but
I think ‘m getting a better feel for “cognitive functions are down, I’m
not even bothering to process what this word says”, which makes the
Stroop test much easier. Might be a useful thing to notice in general.

I’ve done some work on the next iteration of my language tools (now
renamed to “mavothi”), might have some (unusable as-is unless you’re
muflax, but maybe interesting nonetheless) results soon.

I’ve also done a lot of work on steno, which I’ve now started to
actually practice. Actual practice, guys! I’m becoming functional.

I’ve transitioned some archives to
[git-annex](http://git-annex.branchable.com/). For my non-neckbearded
readers, git-annex is basically a system to track archives over multiple
locations (e.g. external drives, remote servers, different laptops) and
automate most of the hassle of having those archives in the first place.

It has a Dropbox-y assistant which I found really awkward to use and
which shredded my configs constantly while I tried to figure out how it
works, so I’m not using it (yet) and do everything via shell commands,
like a man. So my current setup looks like this:

1.  There are multiple independent archives, currently `~/books`,
    `~/games/install` (install files, mods etc. for vidya gaems)
    `~/テレビ` (TV shows and movies) and `~/音` (podcasts, music, etc.),
    which contain a lot of big media. I have complete daily
    backups[^backups] of most of this stuff, but I’d like to a)
    have more backups and b) be able to swap stuff out that I don’t use
    much. I regularly re-watch [‘Allo
    ‘Allo!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Allo_%27Allo!), but there’s
    no point in having it on my main machine all the
    time[^waste]. Git-annex has this nice feature where you can
    `drop` files from one repository and it replaces them with symlinks
    so it looks like the file’s still there and you can move it around,
    but when you try to access it, it’ll tell you what other repository
    (which still has the file) you need to connect so it can get it
    back.

2.  I have a whole lot of external drives because I tend to update
    hardware faster than it breaks, and never throw out old drives (plus
    I have several sources who give me their old stuff too), so I’ve now
    set them up as “trusted”[^trusted] repositories for the
    archives and made sure all files have at least on external copy. I
    update these archives whenever my main machine is full and I want to
    drop files off it. That way, every file is always in at least two
    places and can’t be lost due to drive failure or basic stupidity.

1.  My two laptops (see above) used to just sync my whole home directory
    via [unison](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/), which is
    really wasteful and regularly annoys me because their drives are
    much smaller (and slower), and because unison isn’t too smart.
    git-annex fixes a lot of these issues because now don’t have to copy
    *everything*, but can still keep the directory structure synced.

2.  I currently manually sync the laptops with a simple shell script
    every time I need some data that’s not on the machine, but that
    should eventually become (semi-)automatic too.

What I’d like to do later:

1.  I’m currently syncing stuff on my phone through Dropbox (mostly
    images and audio logs), but once the git-annex android client is a
    bit more solid, I hope to use it there too so I don’t have to trust
    Dropbox anymore.

2.  Get the git-annex assistant running so I don’t have to manually add
    and sync files. That’s still rare enough that it doesn’t bother me
    much, but allegedly this should already be possible. It just
    constantly broke on my setup or was horribly slow, for some reason.

I still expected that there wasn’t a single source of origin (or linear
sequence of origins) for the core NT, that like modern mediums, the
authors were telling stories of their own invention with no real
connections between them, until decades (and sometimes, centuries) later
various churches would try to integrate them into one tradition (with
the well-known result that for every assertion in the NT, there is also
a counter-assertion that contradicts it). This would make a successful
reconstruction essentially impossible because there simple isn’t a
coherent shared thread.

I no longer think that’s necessarily true. I’m not sure that there *is*
a single source of origin (and if so, that it is knowable) either, but
due to a lot of recent reading I’ve done, particularly on the Gospel of
John and its possible (more-or-less) Marcionite origin, there now is a
budding live hypothesis in my head that would make sense of all the
texts and their origin, that answers virtually all important questions
about the NT, and that postulates just such a single origin (of Simon
-\> Marcionite hermeneutics -\> Catholic hijacking). Funnily enough,
that is still in line with my judgment that whatever scripture may have
existed before Marcion is lost to us; I just didn’t expect Marcionites
to be *that* influential for our canon.

I will discuss all of that in detail in due time, but I’m only about 20%
done with all the necessary skills I’ll have to learn (including several
languages) and books I’ll have to read (thankfully all in languages I
know), so this is obviously speculative play still, but the mere
*possibility* of a such a hypothesis and the fact that it can be
directly verified with the evidence we do have, is dazzling.

There are two vectors that I still find deeply puzzling and possibly
beyond our reach - where did the Buddhists get their ideas from, and
what’s up with Simon?

Christian Lindtner claims (and unfortunately I don’t have the skills yet
to even fully comprehend his theory) that the core NT texts are based on
Buddhist sources (which Christian scribes could easily have had access
to thanks to Ashoka), but then we have to trace the underlying ideas
back to India, and there we will likely lose them. Recent research makes
me increasingly skeptical that *any* of the Jewish texts meaningfully
predates the Hellenistic Period (and many not even Christianity!). The
case for Greek priority of the Pentateuch (and a Hebrew translation
second!) seems stronger every year, and even if we “merely” have to
declare pre-Septuagint developments as forever unknowable, that should
equally make us skeptical of Buddhist stories before, say, the
Visuddhimagga.

It would be much easier for my ideas if instead Buddhism took at least
its mythological narratives *from* Christianity (and then historicized
them way in the past), but that’s not a good criterion for truth. :) And
if it is the other way around (which is certainly plausible), then we
have to explain, independently, how the Buddhists got started. The
connection still deeply confuses me, and I follow Lindtner’s suggestion
that I’ll have to learn Sanskrit to adequately understand this
eventually.

The other origin, Simon, is equally mysterious because we simply don’t
have many crucial sources anymore. RMP makes a decent case that at least
his Great Proclamation has been more-or-less completely preserved, but
much of it reads like typical Gnostic gibberish. I feel increasingly
comfortable with various Marcionite writings and their interpretation,
but what’s the deal with Simon? I currently have no idea.

I feel sorry for anyone who wants to start a Post-Simonian Church.
Luckily, I’m merely trying to start the Post-Marcionite one, and that
seems very much doable. Marcion, Appeles, Valentinus, Basilides and
others will be slandered no longer, and one face of “Paul” will be
reconstructed once again. But Simon? Who knows. We might have to fall
back on channeling after all.

We might find ourselves one day, discovering Eris legible all along, in
the setup for Creation’s final pun…

[^scale]:
    Meaning of the scale for the variables, with 2-4 as the typical
    range:

    -   energy level:
        1.  “can’t get up”
        2.  “ugh”
        3.  “functional”
        4.  “movement is light, doing stuff is easy”
        5.  “mania”
    -   comfortableness:
        1.  “paranoia”
        2.  “anxiety”
        3.  “people are nice”
        4.  “feelings are awesome”
        5.  “[Overly Attached
            Girlfriend](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/overly-attached-girlfriend)”
    -   “everything makes sense”-ness:
        1.  “nihilism”
        2.  “knowing stuff is too hard”
        3.  “the world makes sense”
        4.  “everything according to plan”
        5.  “[horse\_ebooks](https://twitter.com/Horse_ebooks/status/326479048945594368)”
    -   body load:
        1.  “Nurgle”
        2.  “nausea”
        3.  “some stomach cramps”
        4.  “Ibuprofen”
        5.  “dissociation”


[^backups]:
    I use a [custom rsync
    script](https://github.com/muflax/scripts/blob/master/rbs) to copy
    everything to a RAID-mirrored backup drive. Daily backups go 1 week
    back, plus there’s an additional monthly version for the last 3
    months. I used to have significantly more past versions (monthly
    backups back to 2010, 2 weeks of daily backups). The main idea was
    that I wanted to have a safeguard against deleting a file and then,
    a week later, noticing I actually still wanted it (which happened
    way too often). Nowadays, I have most of these things in git
    repositories and spread over multiple locations, so restoring
    arbitrary past versions is no problem, and I’m far less
    trigger-happy with deletions in general. The old backups used up a
    lot of space, so I reduced my backup horizon to 1 week (daily) / 3
    months (monthly), although I still have one offsite drive with all
    the old versions (because I only update that every few months).

    I might eventually replace some of that with git-annex too, or
    something like it, but I’m nowhere near comfortable enough with it
    to trust it with my core backups.

[^waste]:
    Unfortunately, the `.git` directory itself tends to use up quite a
    bit of space. For example, my `~/books` directory, which has
    basically all my read-only documents in it, is \~70GB large and has
    \~35k files. The `.git` right after adding the files was already
    \~400M (after doing a `git gc`). However, size tends to depend
    almost exclusively on the number of files, so I did some
    restructuring and packed some stuff up, and reduced my number of
    files to \~8k, and now got only \~160M of `.git` and adding new
    files is reasonably fast (\<20 seconds on the slowest machine). (And
    to be fair, part of that is git’s fault, not git-annex’.)

    So my heuristic for now is that git-annex adds \~1% overhead of the
    total archive size to every repository, which is still worth it most
    of the time (because you can distribute stuff and space is
    reasonably cheap), but it sucks a little.

[^trusted]:
    git-annex has 4 trust levels:

    -   trusted: files are assumed unchanged since the last time we saw
        the repository
    -   semitrusted: files count towards required redundancy, but we
        have to check first if they’re still there
    -   untrusted: location is tracked, but we never expect data to
        still exist
    -   dead: data is gone

    “trusted” makes sense for backup drives that never change on their
    own and are only updated in one direction, “semitrusted” is the
    level for my different machines that might have independent changes
    that need to be merged, and “untrusted” covers drives that are known
    to be failing and aren’t dead yet.

[^oldlogs]:
    Old logs are currently unavailable due to some restructuring. Might
    take some days/weeks/lives.
